* Tasks
** DONE File IO and test
** DONE Stop exploding the heap with logs :DDD
** DONE Fix DONE instruction for VM termination
*** DONE Add setting instructions
** DONE Add assembler
** DONE Chisel tester
** DONE Add LF
** DONE Redo colors in fansi. ANSI fucks up string formatting
** DONE Columnize log events
** DONE Chisel test log evaluator
** DONE Create giftWrapper script
** DONE Better sourceinfo stuff
   Good enough

** DONE Test options
*** DONE How much NOP pad?
*** DONE Verbosity?
*** DONE Which tests?
** DONE ish Step counter, pretty print VM log, including final memory state
** TODO More programs
*** DONE Real programs
*** TODO Basic programs
    Needs more
** DONE Merge in LF changes

** TODO Breakpoints
*** TODO VM breakpoints
**** TODO Record breakpoints in chisel tester
*** TODO Chisel breakpoints
**** TODO Freeze processor to record state
**** TODO Record breakpoints in chisel tester
*** TODO Draw breakpoints in the printer
** TODO Calculate steps needed
** TODO Unmangle derailed traces
   With incorrect designs the trace printer ends up printing a lot of diveregent 
   unsychnronizable blocks
** DONE Fix DONE instruction
*** DONE Parse error
*** DONE Use DONE address
** DONE Hazard generator
   good enough

* Maybe
** DONE Move instruction recording to IMEM rather than IF?
   Only care about what IF gets, won't have to deal with whatever logic is in IF.
** DONE Figure out why loading instructions backwards made shit werk
   Not as funny as you'd think. The issue was overwriting the last written instruction with 0
